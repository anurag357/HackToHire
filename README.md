Here's a high-level plan for developing a flight status and notification system:
## System Architecture (Integration with Airport Systems)
* ###Data Sources: Pull data from airport databases using provided mock data.
* Features:
    * Regularly fetch and update flight status.
    * Handle data parsing and error management.

## Implementation Steps

### Frontend
* Technologies: HTML, CSS, React.js, Axios, jest.
* Features:
   * Display current flight status (real-time updates).
   * User interface for subscribing to notifications.
   * Dashboard showing flight details and updates.

### Backend
* Technologies: Node.js, Express, Middleware, Cors, Firebase-admin, jest supertest.
* Features:
   * API endpoints for retrieving flight data and handling subscriptions.
   * Middleware for handling authentication and data validation.

### Database
* Technologies: MongoDB, Mongoose.
* Features:
   * ###MongoDB: Store user data, preferences, and notification subscriptions.
   * Design schema for MongoDB.
   * Implement data access layers and integration with the backend.
 
### Notifications
* Technologies: Firebase Cloud Messaging.
* Features:
   * Send push notifications for flight status changes.
   * Integration with SMS and email services for broader reach.
   * Implement notification logic and integrate with backend events.
 
### Testing and Deployment:
      * Conduct unit and integration testing library (JEST).
